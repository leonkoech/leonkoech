# Leon Kipkoech

**Founder | Engineer | Researcher**

I build production systems across AI, cloud infrastructure, and human-computer interaction. My work has shipped to millions of users through Google and Microsoft, supported NASA astronaut communication research at MIT Media Lab, and scaled health tech startups from zero.

Currently building at Atano in Miami. Originally from Kenya. 15+ hackathon wins at MIT, Stanford, and Harvard.

**Recent work:**
- Gesture recognition for NASA's Astrobee robot (deaf astronaut communication)
- Distributed data pipelines handling 13M+ records
- RAG systems that cut support calls by 45%
- Embedded CV for real-time sports tracking
